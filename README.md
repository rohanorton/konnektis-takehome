# Konnektis Takehome

The simplest way to run this project is to use docker / docker-compose. Install
instructions can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

```sh
$ docker-compose up
```

This will create an instance of postgresql, creating required tables as well as
starting the app up.
